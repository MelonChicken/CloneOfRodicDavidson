        <p>
          The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)
          is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog is derived from an
          ancient, extinct wolf,and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living
          relative.The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by
          hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of
          agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have
          expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the
          ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
          other canids.
        </p>

          The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various
          behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds
          vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for
          humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting
          police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled
          people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human
          behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent
          study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
          "man's best friend".

          In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in
          his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial
          nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog", and under this
          genus, he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal. He
          classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page,
          classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus. Linnaeus considered the dog
          to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail
          (cauda recurvata), which is not found in any other canid.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicated that the
          domestic dog may have originated from the grey wolf, with the dingo
          and New Guinea singing dog breeds having developed at a time when
          human communities were more isolated from each other. In the third
          edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the
          mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis
          lupus its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies,
          which formed the domestic dog clade: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus
          in 1758 and, dingo named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included
          hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior
          synonym) for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA study as one
          of the guides informing his decision. Mammalogists have noted the
          inclusion of familiaris and dingo together under the "domestic dog"
          clade with some debating it.

          In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's
          Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing
          dog to be feral Canis familiaris and therefore did not assess them for
          the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
